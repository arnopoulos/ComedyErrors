Name:John Oliver

Description:Some British comedian. He hosts a show called "Last Week Tonight". It is a pretty funny show. He talkles a lot of difficult topics and does a good job at doing it. There is a very through video he does on Donald Trump. He was also on the cult comedy "Comunity". Which was very good, if you ignore the fourth season. In addition he had several guest spots on John Steward's show. He was also very good in that show as well. I am still having trouble getting this text to wrap, so I can test whether or not I can scroll in the text view.
